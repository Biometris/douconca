Description: Double constrained correspondence analysis (dc-CA) for analyzing (multi-)trait (multi-)environment ecological data using library vegan and native R code.
   Throughout the two step algorithm of ter Braak et al. (2018) is used. This algorithm combines and extends community- (sample-) and species-level analyses, i.e.
   the usual community weigthed means (CWM)-based regression analysis and the species-level analysis of species-niche centroids (SNC)-based regression analysis.
   The two steps use vegan::cca to regress the abundance data on to the traits and vegan::rda or douconca::wrda to regress the CWM of the orthonormalized traits on to the environemtal predictors.
   vegan::rda is used if the abundance data are divided by the sample total. This division 
   has the advantage that the multivariate analysis corresponds with an unweighted (multi-trait) community-level analysis, instead of being weighted.
   The current vegan-based analysis is efficient for sample-based permutation tests but slow for species-based permutation tests.
   vegan::rda cannot do a weighted analysis, so for the general case weighted redundancy analysis douconca::wrda is used.
