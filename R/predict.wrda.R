#' @description
#' Prediction of  response and lc scores
#' from environment data.
#' 
#' @inheritParams scores.dcca
#'
#' @param object return value of \code{\link{dc_CA}}.
#' @param ...  Other arguments passed to the function (currently ignored).
#' @param type type of prediction, \code{c(
#' "response", "lc")} for 
#' response (expected abundance) and constrained scores for sites. 
#' @param newdata Data in which to look for variables with which to predict.
#' @param rank rank (number of axes to use). Default "full" for all axes 
#' (no rank-reduction).
#' @param weights list of weights of species and of sites in \code{newdata} 
#' when \code{type = "response"}, else ignored (default NULL
#' yielding equal species and site weights, both summing to 1). 
#' Example: weights = list(species = c(100, 1, 1), sites = c(1, 1, 1, 1)), in 
#' that order, with traits of three new species in newdata[[1]] and 
#' environmental values (and levels of factors) of four new sites in 
#' newdata[[2]]. Species weights are scaled to a sum of one.				  
#' 
#' @details
#' Variables that are in the model but not in \code{newdata} are set to their 
#' weighted means in the training data. Predictions are thus at the (weighted)
#' mean of the quantitative variables not included. Predictions with 
#' not-included factors are at the reference level (the first level of the 
#' factor).
#'
#' For \code{type = "response"}, many of the predicted values may be negative, 
#' indicating expected absences (0) or small expected response values.
#' 
#' @returns a matrix with the predictions. The exact content of the matrix 
#' depends on the \code{type} of predictions that are being made.
