R library \code{douconca} analyzes multi-trait multi-environment ecological data 
by double constrained correspondence analysis (ter Braak et al. 2018) 
using \code{vegan} and native R code. It has a \code{formula} interface
for the trait- (column-) and environment- (row-) models,
which allows to assess, for example, the importance
of trait interactions in shaping ecological communities.
Throughout the two step algorithm of ter Braak et al. (2018) is used. This 
algorithm combines and extends community- (sample-) and species-level analyses, 
i.e. the usual community weighted means (CWM)-based regression analysis and the
species-level analysis of species-niche centroids (SNC)-based regression 
analysis. The CWM regressions are specified with an environmental formula 
and the SNC regressions are specified with a trait formula. dcCA finds 
the environmental and trait gradients that optimize these regressions.
The first step uses \code{\link[vegan]{cca}} (Oksanen et al. 2022)
to regress the transposed abundance data on to the traits and (weighted) 
redundancy analysis to regress the community-weighted means (CWMs) of the 
orthonormalized traits, obtained from the first step, on to the environmental 
predictors. The sample total of the abundance data are used as weights.
The redundancy analysis is carried out using \code{vegan} 
\code{\link[vegan]{rda}} if sites have equal weights (after division of the 
rows by their total) or, in the general weighted case, using \code{\link{wrda}}.
Division by the sample total has the advantage that the multivariate analysis 
corresponds with an unweighted (multi-trait) community-level analysis, instead 
of being weighted, which may give a puzzling difference between common 
univariate and this multivariate analysis.
